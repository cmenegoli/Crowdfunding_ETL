# Crowdfunding_ETL
The team developed an ETL pipeline for loading crowdfunding data from Excel files into a relational database using Python, Pandas, and PostgreSQL. 

## Background 

We developed an ETL pipeline to process crowdfunding data from Excel files as practice for this project. The data was extracted and processed it, then used the four CSV files to build an entity relationship diagram (ERD) and a table schema. The CSV files were then added to a PostgreSQL database.

Create the Contacts DataFrame

### 1. Create the Category DataFrame
